# Introduction

Hello viewer and welcome to my submission for Challenge 3 aka the python-challenge. For context, at the time of writing this, I am enrolled in the Data Analytics and Visualizations bootcamp with the University of MN. We are assigned a challenge homework per module. This is Module 3's challenge on Python. I am using a windows/PC laptop. 

# Overview

This specific challange had two parts, PyBank and PuPoll. The first part of the challenge was to create a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company given a financial dataset called "budget_data.csv which is composed of two columns "Date" and "Value." More specifically we were to analyze the PyBank records to calculate: the total number of months included in the dataset, the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes, the greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period, and lastly the greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period. The second part of the challenge was to create a Python script to analyze the ballots for a fictional small town given a completely different dataset called "election_data.csv" which is composed of three columns: "Voter ID," "County," and "Candidate." More specifically we were to analyze the PyPoll votes and calculate: the total number of votes cast, a complete list of candidates who received votes, the percentage of votes each candidate won, the total number of votes each candidate won, and lastly the winner of the election based on popular vote. In addition to that, both scripts should print the analyses to the terminal and export a text file with the results. To ensure we were on the right path when coding, we were also given references on how both text files should appear. 

# Additional information

In this repository, you will find the reference screenshots, images from the given challenge, a PyBank folder (consisting of the budget data set, my PyBank script, and my PyBank analysis text file), and a PyPoll folder (consisting of the election dataset, my PyPoll script, and my PyPoll analysis text). I did not use any outside sources for this challenge other than my amazing tutor (shout out to him) Geronimo Perez. He taught me how to set variables that hold two different values in the list (which helped with getting the greatest increase and decrease in PyBank), how to use a template using f'''<content>''' which helped print the values in a neat fashion, and how to format the values using commas and ".2f" or ".3f". Otherwise, everything else was retained information gathered from my classes and class activities. As always, a big shout out to my bootcamp TAs Sam and Randy for all their help answering my questions during office hours, my instructor Hunter for always being clear in his articulation of the course material, and my classmates for their encouragement and support.
